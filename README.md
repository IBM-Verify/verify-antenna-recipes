# IBM Verify Antenna Recipes

Welcome to IBM Verify Antenna Recipes!

This repository contains starter kits and recipes for IBM Verify Antenna, a self-hosted component that enables applications and systems to comply with the [OpenID Shared Signals](https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0.html) standard.

## What is IBM Verify Antenna?

IBM Verify Antenna provides an event processing framework that enables real-time integrations between different systems and applications using the OpenID Shared Signals Framework. It can be run as a:

1. **Transmitter** - Collects events from sources and processes them according to configured rules to build SSF events
2. **Receiver** - Receives processed events from the Transmitter and integrates them with target systems

Verify Antenna allows organizations to:

- Respond to security events in real-time
- Automate workflows based on identity events
- Integrate systems and applications using open standards
- Create custom event processing pipelines

## Documentation
